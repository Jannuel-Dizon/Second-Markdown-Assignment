If a bettor were to attempt to cover all the possible combinations of the **Ultra Lotto**, the bettor would incur a massive loss, as the grand prize is not nearly enough to cover the expenses made, much less bring a profit. The game has six 2-blank spaces, with each spaces to be filled with (single) digits. The bettor has 10 digits to choose from (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3... 9) to fill each blank spaces. Using the fundamental counting principle, the total number of possible combinations is **1000000000000**, with **x**, being the number of choices to fill a blank, equal to 10 and **y**, being the total number of blanks to fill, equal to 12.

With the price per ticket being â‚±20, the total amount the bettor has to spend would be **20000000000000**.
