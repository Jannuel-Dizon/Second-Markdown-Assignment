![Monty Hall problem](./pictures/mhall.jpg)

The premise behind the Monty Hall problem is that you are presented with 3 doors behind two of the doors are goats and 1 of the door is a car. At the start you will be given a chance to choose one door and after confirming your choice they will open of one of the door.

At this point in time you will have a 1 in 3 chance of selecting the door with the car behind it and 2 in 3 with a goat behind  it.

After revealing one of the doors, which will always be a goat, you will be given a choice to change the door you chose or not. The big question is should you change doors or not. I believe that you should always switch.

### Answer

Lets say you will always choose door 1 and your strategy is to always switch at the second round

First Round

  Scenario 1
  
    Car/Goat/Goat
    
  Scenario 2
    
    Goat/Car/Goat
    
  Scenario 3
    
    Goat/Goat/Car
    
  You are more likely to choose a goat in door 1.
      
      2/3 for goat
      1/3 for car
  
Second Round

  In the scenario that you chose a car in the first place they will reveal either of the door with a goat in it and you will lose. But then again this is only gonna happen 1/3 of the time.
  
    Car/**Goat**/Goat
    Car/Goat/**Goat**
  
  In the scenario that you chose a goat in the first place, which is more likely going to happen with 2/3 chances, they will be forced to show the goat. But because you know that they will do this in this scenario you know that the car will always be in the other door and you win.
  
    Goat/Car/**Goat**
    Goat/**Goat**/Car
  
  The only time where you cannot say for certain what you will be choosing would be at the start It will be either the car or the goats. After they show you where one of the goat is the probability breaks down because either you win or lose  with this strategy, with a 2/3 of the time you will win. 
  
  If you changed your strategy and will never switch then your probability of winning goes down to 1/3 because for you to win with this strategy you should be able to choose the car which is only in 1 of the 3 doors, which makes it 1/3.

The figure above shows how the probability of winning the PCSO Ultra Lotto 6/58 was achieved. This means that the chance of winning is 1/29,142,257,760 or roughly 0.0000000000343%. Buying all of the tickets would mean spending ₱582,845,155,200.00
